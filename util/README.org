* Util dir

This contains various programs that are not important, but are helpful
in using TV Downloader.  The code is of low quality here so ymmv.


** files

*deluge_done.bash* - This script is is called when deluge is finished
 downloading the torrent.  It moves the finished torrents to a network
 drive.  It works with the execute plugin.

*map_tvdb_to_rage.py* - This script maps the tvdb id's to ragetv's id's.

*move-nzbs-to-watched-dir* - When downloading nzb files, I download them
 to a staging folder then use this script to move which ones I want to
 the sabnzbd watched folder.  This really is an unnecessary step.

*sabnzbd-move-video* - When sabnzb is finished downloading, it calls
 this script which moves the finished files to a network drive.

*tv-completion.bash* - Bash command line completions for TV Downloader.

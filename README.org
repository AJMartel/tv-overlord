* TV Downloader

A command line tool to download and manage TV shows from newsgroups or
bittorent.  It will download nzb files or magnet links.

TV Downloader keeps track of which shows have been downloaded and what
shows are available to download.

There are two NZB search providers, nzbclub.com and nzbindex.com.
Also, there are two bittorent search providers, kickass.to and
thepiratebay.sx.

** Install

TV Downloader has been tested on Linux and Mac.  It would probably not
be to hard to make it work on windows, and if anyone is interested, I
can take a look at making it work or alternatively send me a pull request.

TV Downloader requires two additional python libraries to be installed:
  1. tvdb_api - [[https://github.com/dbr/tvdb_api]]
  2. Beautiful Soup - http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/

Install steps:
  1. =easy_install tvdb_api=
  2. =easy_install beautifulsoup4=
  3. Clone this repository
  4. Put tv.py on your $PATH or call it directly
     (I have it symlinked to =tv= in a bin folder thats on the path)
  5. type: =tv=
     The first time its run, it will ask to create the
     config dir.  Type =Y= to allow it.  The config directory will be
     created in your home dir called =.tv-downloader/=
  6. Type =tv addnew "someshow";= to start.


** How to use

:tv addnew "show name"

tv will search thetvdb.com for a match to your show name.  If the show
it asks you is not the right one, it helps to add the year to the
name: =tv addnew 'show name year';=.

=tv showmissing=

This will list any shows that are ready to download.

=tv download=

For each show thats ready to download, it will ask you which one you
want to download.

=tv info=

This will show you what shows are next, and how many days till they
are broadcast

=tv nondbshow "some search name";=

This will show you matches to your search.  Anything downloaded this
way will not be recorded in your database.

=tv providers=

This will list search providers available to the program.  The default
one is the provider at the top of the list in config.ini.

=tv editdbinfo "exact show name";=

Edit the data in the database for show name.

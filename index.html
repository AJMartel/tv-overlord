        <p>TV Overlord keeps track of which shows have been downloaded
          and what shows are available to download.</p>
        <p>For each new episode of a tv show you are tracking, you are
          given a list of possible downloads to choose.  If you use a
          torrent search provider, a magnet link is passed to the
          default bittorent client.  If it is an NZB search, an NZB
          file is placed in a folder that is configured in the
          configuration file.</p>
        <p>For torrent files, you can also have your shows organized
          after downloading.  If you use transmission or deluge, those
          clients can be configured to call a script when each torrent
          is complete.  This script will extract the video file from
          the downloaded folder, rename it, and put it in a separate
          folder organized into sub folders named for each tv
          show. Get more information about the <a href="https://github.com/8cylinder/tv-overlord/wiki/Rename-tags">
          Rename tags here.</a></p>
        <p>There are several bittorent search providers and two NZB
          search providers and new ones can be added fairly easily.
          See the search providers
          <a href="https://github.com/8cylinder/tv-overlord/tree/master/tvoverlord/search_providers"

        <h2>Why semi automatic</h2>
        <p>Semi automatic means that you manually run it and select
          from a list each episode you want. The reason for this is that
          not all torrents follow a naming convention that is parsable,
          especially for more obscure shows. So instead of writing a ton
          of code to try and figure out information about an episode,
          Iâ€™ll use the parser built into my brain. Also I like that it
          runs when I like, its light weight, and there are no
          background processes.</p>
